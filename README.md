BandSpot:
created by: Dan Troeber, Jan Balangue, Anthony Edelstein & Philippe Recto

ABOUT:
This app was created as a useful tool to music fanatics who want to follow their artists and seek out their live perfomances.

The user needs only to type in the name of the artist and will be able to get all they need to find their websites, instagram, facebook, and tour dates.

There is a large search input form at the top of the page where it is easily identifiable. Once the user presses enter, the tabs below will populate the information needed in the appropriate tabs so that the page remains neat and orderly. So as not to overload the screen with too much clutter. 

In addition to social media links and concert information, the user will also have a pull of similar artists based on genre and a space to save their favorite artists links and dates for easy access to repull.


First Tab: Artist
This tab displays an image of the artist and links to their facebook, instagram and website. If the artist does not have 1 or all 3 social media sites in the pull, the icon is greyed out. 

The icons are links that will open another tab in the browser keeping the BandSpot site open for the user to quickly refer back to. 

Second Tab: Location/Tour
This tab displays the artists upcoming performances, dates and venues.

Third Tab: Similar Artists
This tab displays artists that the user may like based on similar genres.


Fourth Tab: Favorite Artists
This tab will be used to store the users favorite artist/s he or she is following.

Future Developments:
Our team plans to improve the site by adding to the tours/locations tab a ticket purchasing option, sample audio/video of the artist they pull, and artist write ups. Possible layouts may change, but for the most part, we believe that the end user will appreciate the uncluttered design.
